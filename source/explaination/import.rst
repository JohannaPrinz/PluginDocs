How to import the exported files into your web application
==========================================================

In your folder, you selected for saving the export, you will find the js file, the css file, a index.html file, an other .html file and a material folder, where all your images will be saved.

.. figure:: /material/files.PNG
    :name: files
    :alt: content of your export folder
    :width: 150%
    :align: right

    content of your folder you selected for the export.


1. Copy those three things: the js file, the css file and the material folder 
2. Paste them into your web application
3. Make sure you copy the images as well and not only the folder (otherwise drag the image in the copyed folder)
4. Read the TO-DO in the js-file 
5. Place your HTML tag [#FN1]_ on the position you want to have your component on your Website

.. hint::

    | If you have the material folder or the CSS file in another folder than the js file
    | you have to adjust the source link, so that the js file can finde everything.


.. [#FN1] with a webcomponent you will create your own tag, so you may have to add the tag to your custom tags before it will work correctly
