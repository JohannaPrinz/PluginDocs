Handle the JS File
====================

In the jf file you will finde the HTML structur of your component.

| Here you can make changes that will effect the construction or order of the different elements.
| Unfortunatelly you have to format the HTML structur by hand
| Otherwise the indentations aren't correct
| (That would effect the functionallity, but it's easier to read and it simlpy looks nicer)
