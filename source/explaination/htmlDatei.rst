Extra HTML file
================

| The extra .html file contains only the hmlt structur of the component.
| So you can use this for example in Angular or other projects.

.. hint:: 
    | this file does not contain the style file (.css file)
    | For that you have to integrate the css file like:
    | **<link rel="stylesheet" href="*css-file-name*">**
