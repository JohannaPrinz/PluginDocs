Extra .html file
================

| The extra .html file contains only the hmlt structur of the component.
| So you can use this for example in Angular or other projects.

.. hint:: 
    | This file does not contain the style file (.css file)
    | For that you have to integrate the css-file.
    | Simply paste following tag into the html-file and enter the correct css-file-name.
    | **<link rel="stylesheet" href="*css-file-name*">**
